# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

Follow these steps to push your Imran Khan Voting dApp to GitHub:

## 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
3. Enter a repository name (e.g., `imran-khan-vote`)
4. Add an optional description: "A modern dApp for voting on Imran Khan as the rightful Prime Minister of Pakistan"
5. Choose whether to make the repository public or private
6. Do NOT initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these files)
7. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands to push your existing repository. Use the following commands:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory (if you're not already there)
cd /Users/zeeshankhan/CascadeProjects/imran-khan/imran-khan-vote

# Add the GitHub repository as a remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/imran-khan-vote.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

## 3. Verify Your Repository

1. Go to `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/imran-khan-vote`
2. Ensure all your files have been successfully pushed
3. Your README.md should be displayed on the repository homepage

## 4. Additional GitHub Setup (Optional)

Consider adding these to your GitHub repository:

1. **GitHub Pages**: Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings to create a demo site
2. **Issues**: Use GitHub Issues for tracking bugs and feature requests
3. **Pull Request Template**: Add a template for contributors
4. **GitHub Actions**: Set up CI/CD workflows for automated testing and deployment

## 5. Sharing Your Repository

Share your repository URL with others to collaborate or showcase your work:

```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/imran-khan-vote
```

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter authentication issues, you may need to use a personal access token or set up SSH keys
- If you have large files that exceed GitHub's file size limits, consider using Git LFS
